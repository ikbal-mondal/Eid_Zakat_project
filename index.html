                    Having taqwa means to be conscious of Allah in all our actions. If our Qurbani is merely a yearly
                    ritual that we tick off our calendar without truly reflecting on it, have we been conscious of Allah
                    while doing it? .

                <p class="flex_div_p">
                    Qurbani, or Udhiya as it is known in Arabic, is not simply the slaughtering of an animal and the
                    distribution of its meat. Nor is it merely a emorative ritual centred around the sacrifice of
                    Ibrahim (as).The word ‘Qurbani’ is derived from the Arabic, ‘qurban’, which has its root in the
                    Arabic word ‘qurb’ – meaning ‘nearness’. The purpose of offering Qurbani is to draw near to Allah.
                    There are two Qur’anic stories that illustrate how we can draw closer to Allah through Qurbani: the
                    story of Adam’s (as) sons, and the story of Ibrahim (as). For poor families, meat is an unaffordable
                    luxury and so it is a joyous occasion when they can enjoy a Qurbani meal.

                <p class="flex_div_p">

                    Allah accepted Habil’s sacrifice, ascending it to heaven, and He rejected Qabil’s sacrifice. Habil
                    explained to his brother that Allah only accepts from those who have taqwa. Qabil had clearly not
                    made his sacrifice with sincerity, and Allah was aware of that. Qabil was jealous of the way Habil
                    had been favoured over him, and he killed his brother. So the first way to draw closer to Allah
                    through Qurbani is to be completely sincere in what you are offering and to have taqwa. Having taqwa
                    means to be conscious of Allah in all our actions. If our Qurbani is merely a yearly ritual that we
                    tick off our calendar without truly reflecting on it,

                <p class="flex_div_p">

                    This is the essence of Qurbani: to reaffirm that we completely submit to Allah and we reject
                    disobedience to Him. We will sacrifice what is most dear to us if Allah asks it, just to be close to
                    Him and gain His pleasure, even if Shaytaan tries to deter us. Qurbani is a reaffirmation that we
                    will sacrifice our wealth, our time, our work, our homes – all for the sake of Allah. As Ibrahim
                    (as) prepared a knife to sacrifice his son and a shroud to bury him in, he couldn’t face Isma’il
                    (as), so he turned his son’s face away. According to Ibn Kathir’s tafseer, they both membered Allah
                    and testified their faith in Him.

                    The Qurbani that we perform today is according to the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad (saw). On the
                    first day of Eid al-Adha (10th Dhul Hijjah), after Eid prayer, we sacrifice an animal for the sake
                    of Allah and then distribute its meat to the needy. The Prophet (saw) evidently reflected on the
                    rich heritage of Qurbani, for he (saw) even said: I am the son of two sacrificed people.” This
                    refers to the fact that both his father Abdullah and his ancestor Isma’il (as) were almost
                    sacrificed for Allah’s sake, emphasizing his connection with Isma’il. He (saw) also used to look for
                    rams similar to the one Habil (rh) and Ibrahim (as) sacrificed – white-horned rams – to offer as
                    Qurbani on Eid al-Adha (Ahmad).

            Many Muslims make only one pilgrimage trip during their lifetimes. In the days and weeks after Hajj, many
            pilgrims thus take advantage of their travel time by visiting the city of Madinah, 270 miles north
            of Makkah. The people of Madinah provided refuge to the early Muslim community when they were being
            persecuted by the powerful Makkan tribes. Madinah became a center for the growing Muslim
